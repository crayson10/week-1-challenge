In this assignment, I changed the title, made the imagaes and icons accesible, added HTML semantic elements, organized the css to make it less crowded, made notes of most of my changes, and also arranged elements to follow the logical structure of styling and positioning. I did stress during the process of all of this but enjoyed working on it. The TA's helped me when my formating was off at a point and I got some tips from my peers!
